Thank you for downloading my project! This project was a code challenge in which the goal was to traverse files
in a directory (including subdirectories) and displaying them.

The only constrains were allowing the user to choose the extension type, and how far back to look for files.
In other words, allowing the user to specify what files to select given the last modification timestamp.
It does not sound that hard, does it? And it was not. However, lets just say it took me a little longer
than anticipated. How long you ask? Well, about 2h 45min when you ignore all the small adjustments to
the user interface towards the end.

How do you use it? Its very simple. Select a folder and specify the file extension (e.g. txt), and how many
days back to look for. If you leave the days field as zero, it will just ignore this constrain. The files fill
show bellow broken down into groups depending on their directory. Give it a try!

The time limit was 2 hours, which I thought was plenty.  I spent some time brainstorming, designing the architecture,
the design pattern, a little abstraction here and there, and voila! We are ready to start coding. This is always a 
very good practice to follow when doing any time of software development. Even if you make some changes to the
architecture, this "sketch" allows you to stick (somewhat) to a plan. This alone took me about 30 min.

Yes, it took about 30 minutes to come but with a plan that I later changed anyway! What was all that for then? Well,
it was helpful, but software development is a very fluid profession. Design changes are a certainty in most cases if 
not all. This is the reason small projects very often just skip this step and are designed as they are constructed.

Im not discouraged given the result. I think this just goes to show that deadlines are hard to meet. There will be
delays, changes to the code, changes to the requirements, etc. This is just life as a software developer.
Ask anyone you know is a developer by profession.

Did I fail the challenge? Well, technically yes. I did go over the time limit. I was however able to explain my
thought process on the architecture design and the reasons behind many of my decisions. I believe that is just
as important as finishing in time.

What did I get from all of this? I am not sure. These days I have found myself pondering about what I get from
doing what I do. What do I like about being a software developer? In general, I like building things. But when
it comes to software development, the sense of building something from something as abstract as an idea is
very satisfying. If there is anything to be said about this project, is that is mine. That is all I need.
